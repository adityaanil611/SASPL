EXPERIMENT 3 — VOICED, UNVOICED, AND SILENCE CLASSIFICATION
================================================================================

THEORY
======

Classification uses Short-Time Energy and ZCR thresholds:

• VOICED: high energy, low ZCR (periodic signals from vocal fold vibration)
• UNVOICED: medium energy, high ZCR (aperiodic noise-like sounds)
• SILENCE: low energy, low ZCR (background noise or pauses)

Dynamic thresholds (adaptive to recording) ensure accuracy across different
recording conditions and speakers.

CLASSIFICATION LOGIC:
---------------------
if (energy < threshold_silence) AND (ZCR < threshold_silence_ZCR):
    → SILENCE
elif (ZCR < threshold_voiced):
    → VOICED
else:
    → UNVOICED

CONCEPT QUESTIONS
=================

1. Why is classification important?
   → To segment speech for recognition, compression, or enhancement.

2. Why use both energy and ZCR?
   → Energy alone fails for fricatives; ZCR adds spectral information.

3. What happens if the thresholds are static?
   → Misclassification due to amplitude variations across recordings.

4. What are examples of voiced sounds?
   → Vowels (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/) and voiced consonants (/b/, /d/, /g/).

5. What are examples of unvoiced sounds?
   → Fricatives (/s/, /f/, /sh/, /th/) and stops (/p/, /t/, /k/).

6. How does ZCR help distinguish voiced from unvoiced?
   → Voiced sounds have low ZCR (periodic); unvoiced have high ZCR (random).

7. What is voice activity detection (VAD)?
   → Algorithm to detect presence/absence of speech in audio signal.

8. Why use adaptive thresholds?
   → To handle variations in recording level, background noise, and speaker 
   characteristics.

9. What statistical measures can be used for adaptive thresholding?
   → Median, mean, standard deviation, median absolute deviation (MAD).

10. What is the role of frame overlap in classification?
    → Provides smooth transitions and reduces classification jitter.

11. How can you improve classification accuracy?
    → Combine with autocorrelation, spectral features, or machine learning.

12. What is a hangover scheme in VAD?
    → Continuing to mark frames as speech for a short duration after speech 
    ends to avoid chopping.
