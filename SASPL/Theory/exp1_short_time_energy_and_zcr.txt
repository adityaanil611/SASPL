EXPERIMENT 1 — SHORT-TIME ENERGY (STE) AND ZERO-CROSSING RATE (ZCR)
================================================================================

THEORY
======

Speech is a non-stationary signal; its energy and frequency content vary over 
time. To analyze it, short-time (frame-based) processing is used.

SHORT-TIME ENERGY (STE):
------------------------
E(n) = Σ [x(m)w(n-m)]²

It measures the signal's local power and is high during voiced speech or bursts.

ZERO-CROSSING RATE (ZCR):
--------------------------
Z(n) = (1/2N) Σ |sgn[x(m)] - sgn[x(m-1)]|

It counts how often the waveform crosses zero; higher in unvoiced segments 
(e.g., /s/, /f/) and lower in voiced parts.

CONCEPT QUESTIONS
=================

1. Why do we use short-time analysis instead of whole-signal analysis?
   → Because speech is quasi-stationary over short durations (10–30 ms).

2. What does a high ZCR indicate?
   → Presence of unvoiced or noisy sounds.

3. Why normalize the signal before analysis?
   → To make energy independent of amplitude scaling.

4. What is the trade-off between frame size and resolution?
   → Shorter frames give better time but poorer frequency resolution.

5. What window functions can be used?
   → Rectangular, Hamming, Hanning; Hamming is preferred for smooth edges.

6. What is the typical frame duration for speech analysis?
   → 10–30 ms (20 ms is most common).

7. What is frame overlap and why is it used?
   → Overlapping frames (25–50%) ensure smooth transitions and prevent 
   information loss at frame boundaries.

8. How does ZCR differ between voiced and unvoiced speech?
   → Voiced: low ZCR (periodic); Unvoiced: high ZCR (aperiodic/noisy).

9. What happens to STE during silence?
   → STE drops to near zero or background noise level.

10. Why is speech considered quasi-stationary?
    → Its statistical properties remain approximately constant over short 
    intervals (10–30 ms).

ADVANTAGES
==========
• Simple and computationally light
• Effective for voiced/unvoiced classification
• Suitable for real-time implementation

DISADVANTAGES
=============
• Sensitive to noise
• Requires adaptive thresholds for different speakers or environments
• Cannot distinguish between different types of voiced sounds
• Performance degrades in noisy environments
• Fixed thresholds may not generalize across recordings

APPLICATIONS
============
• Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
• Speech endpoint detection
• Preliminary feature extraction in speech recognition

• Pre-processing for more complex algorithms

USE CASES
=========
• Mobile phones: VAD for battery-saving during calls
• Smart speakers: Wake-word detection preprocessing
• Hearing aids: Noise reduction trigger

RELATED CONCEPTS
================
• Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)
• Windowing functions (Hamming, Hanning, Blackman)

PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
=========================
• Sampling rate: 8–16 kHz typical for speech
