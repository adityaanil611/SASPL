EXPERIMENT 4 — WIDEBAND AND NARROWBAND SPECTROGRAMS
================================================================================

THEORY
======

Spectrogram = time–frequency representation using STFT (Short-Time Fourier 
Transform):

S(t, f) = Σ x[n] w[n - t] e^(-j2πfn)

WIDEBAND SPECTROGRAM:
---------------------
• Short window (5–10 ms)
• High time resolution, low frequency resolution
• Shows vertical striations (glottal pulses)
• Good for phonetic timing and transient analysis

NARROWBAND SPECTROGRAM:
-----------------------
• Long window (30–50 ms)
• High frequency resolution, low time resolution
• Shows horizontal bands (harmonics)
• Good for pitch and harmonic analysis

UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE:
----------------------
Δt × Δf ≥ 1/(4π)

Cannot have high resolution in both time and frequency simultaneously.

CONCEPT QUESTIONS
=================

1. Why use STFT?
   → To analyze non-stationary signals in both time and frequency domains.

2. What determines resolution?
   → Window length: short → time-precise; long → frequency-precise.

3. Typical window sizes?
   → 10 ms (wideband), 40 ms (narrowband).

4. What are harmonics in a spectrogram?
   → Multiples of fundamental frequency visible as horizontal bands in 
   narrowband spectrograms.

5. What is the time-frequency uncertainty principle?
   → Cannot achieve arbitrarily high resolution in both time and frequency 
   simultaneously.

6. What are formant tracks in a spectrogram?
   → Dark horizontal/curved bands showing vocal tract resonances over time.

7. What causes vertical striations in wideband spectrograms?
   → Individual glottal pulses (pitch periods) during voiced speech.

8. Why use log frequency scale in spectrograms?
   → Matches human perception and better displays low-frequency detail.

9. What is a formant transition?
   → Change in formant frequencies during consonant-vowel or vowel-consonant 
   transitions.

10. How do you identify voicing in a spectrogram?
    → Presence of periodic structure (harmonics) or vertical striations.

11. What window function is commonly used?
    → Hamming window for good frequency resolution and low side lobes.

12. What is the difference between spectrogram and spectrum?
    → Spectrum: single time snapshot; Spectrogram: time-varying spectrum.

ADVANTAGES
==========
• Intuitive visual interpretation
• Allows dynamic speech feature tracking
• Reveals both temporal and spectral characteristics
• Useful for manual phonetic analysis
• Can identify speech sounds, pitch, formants simultaneously
• Educational tool for understanding speech production
• Supports qualitative and quantitative analysis

DISADVANTAGES
=============
• Trade-off between time/frequency resolution
• Computationally heavy for real-time use on large files
• Requires expertise for interpretation
• May need different parameters for different analysis goals
• Storage-intensive for long recordings
• Not easily quantifiable for automated processing

APPLICATIONS
============
• Speech phoneme analysis
• Sound event classification
• Forensic and linguistic studies
• Bird song analysis
• Music transcription
• Speech pathology diagnosis
• Voice quality assessment
• Sonar and radar signal analysis
• Biomedical signal analysis (ECG, EEG)

USE CASES
=========
• Phonetics research: Analyzing articulation patterns
• Speech therapy: Visualizing pronunciation
• Forensic analysis: Speaker identification
• Music education: Showing pitch and timbre

RELATED CONCEPTS
================
• Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)
• Time-frequency analysis
• Wavelet transform
• Gabor transform
• Wigner-Ville distribution
• Mel-spectrogram
• Constant-Q transform

PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
=========================
• Choose window length based on analysis goal:
  - Phonetic segmentation: wideband
  - Pitch/harmony analysis: narrowband
• Overlap: 50–75% common for smooth display
• FFT size: typically 256–2048 depending on resolution needs
• Dynamic range: adjust color mapping for visibility
• Use log magnitude for better perceptual representation
• Pre-emphasis filter can improve high-frequency visibility
